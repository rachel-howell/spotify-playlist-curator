# Spotify Playlist Curator

A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill that gives AI agents musical intuition. Instead of wrapping API calls behind a chat interface, it provides a framework for *reasoning about sound* — audio DNA profiling, multi-source recommendations with scored explanations, and tools for blending aesthetics across artists and genres. The agent doesn't just fetch tracks; it understands why they belong together, explains its choices, and adapts when the vibe is off.

## What can it do?

Describe what you want in natural language. The agent translates your intent into audio features, artist networks, and genre affinities, then builds a playlist grounded in real data.

**Some examples:**

- *"Make me a playlist that combines the sound of Lana Del Rey's 'Venice Bitch' with Mitski's 'My Love Mine All Mine', about an hour long, and don't include 'Mariner's Apartment Complex'"* — seeds from specific tracks, blends both artists' sonic profiles, trims to duration, excludes the named track
- *"Based on the songs I've been listening to lately, pick the high-energy ones and put a playlist together for my gym session. Throw in a few new ones that match the vibe"* — pulls recent listening history, filters by energy and danceability, seeds recommendations from the top matches
- *"Take my road trip playlist and make it more upbeat without losing the indie feel"* — analyzes the existing playlist's audio DNA, recommends tracks that boost energy and danceability while preserving genre affinity
- *"A playlist of only Bjork and Radiohead deep cuts"* — pulls artist catalogs directly, filters by popularity
- *"Blend the vibe of my gym playlist with my lo-fi study playlist"* — profiles both playlists' audio features, finds the fusion zone, sources candidates that live in the overlap

The agent explains its reasoning at every step — which seeds it chose and why, what audio features it's targeting, and what trade-offs it made.

## How it works

The skill is built around three ideas:

### 1. Musical vocabulary

Audio features (energy, danceability, valence, acousticness, tempo, loudness) aren't just numbers — they map to musical concepts the agent uses to reason about requests. "Melancholic" means low valence + moderate energy. "Intimate" means low loudness + high acousticness. The agent speaks this language when making and explaining decisions.

### 2. Multi-source recommendation engine

A 3-tier fallback chain ensures recommendations work even as Spotify deprecates endpoints:

- **Tier 1** — [ReccoBeats](https://reccobeats.com) for similarity-based recommendations and audio feature data
- **Tier 2** — Audio-feature scoring when ReccoBeats recommendations are unavailable but feature data still is
- **Tier 3** — Spotify-only fallback using search, genre overlap, and artist proximity

Each tier produces scored results with human-readable explanations (`"genre match"`, `"audio match: energy=0.05, valence=0.03"`, `"boosted artist"`), so the agent can evaluate and adjust before committing.

### 3. DNA blending

For fusion requests ("X meets Y", "blend these two playlists"), `blend-dna` profiles two track groups independently, computes a target zone in audio-feature space, then scores candidates by how well they sit in the overlap. The output includes per-feature distances so the agent can see exactly where a track falls relative to both source aesthetics.

## Features

| Capability | Details |
|---|---|
| Natural language playlists | Describe a vibe, mood, or reference point — the agent handles seed selection, genre targeting, and audio feature alignment |
| Seed from anything | Specific tracks, artists, existing playlists, genres, or your listening history |
| Audio DNA profiling | Analyze any playlist or set of tracks for energy, danceability, valence, acousticness, tempo, loudness, and more |
| Aesthetic blending | Fuse two distinct musical identities with adjustable weighting |
| Scored recommendations | Every recommendation comes with a composite score and reasons — the agent curates, not just retrieves |
| Constraint mapping | "no X", "more Y", "deep cuts", "bangers", "about an hour" — natural language constraints map to CLI flags |
| Taste memory | Excluded artists, favorite genres, and free-text notes persist across sessions |
| Listening history | Pull from recent plays, top tracks, and top artists across time ranges |
| Playlist operations | Create, modify, analyze, queue tracks, search catalog |

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- A [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) app (free)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rachel-howell/spotify-playlist-curator.git
cd spotify-playlist-curator
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

### 2. Configure Spotify credentials

Create an app at [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard). Set the redirect URI to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`.

Add your credentials to `.env`:

```
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

### 3. Authenticate

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/spotify_auth.py
```

This opens a browser for Spotify OAuth consent and saves your tokens locally.

### 4. Register as a Claude Code skill

Add the skill to your Claude Code configuration so the agent loads it automatically for music-related requests. See the [Claude Code skills documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) for setup instructions.

### 5. Verify

Ask Claude Code to check the connection:

```
> check my spotify connection status
```

The agent will run `status` and confirm authentication is working.

The skill file (`SKILL.md`) isn't just API documentation — it's a reasoning framework that teaches the agent how to think about music. It includes a musical vocabulary, a 6-step workflow for non-trivial requests, a diagnostic table for when recommendations miss the mark, and guardrails for playlist modification.

## Spotify API status (March 2026)

This project works around several Spotify Web API regressions:

| Endpoint | Status | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /recommendations` | Removed | ReccoBeats + fallback chain |
| `GET /audio-features` | Removed | ReccoBeats audio features |
| `GET /artists/{id}/related-artists` | Removed | Collaborator discovery via ReccoBeats |
| `GET /artists/{id}/top-tracks` | 403 | Search-based fallback |
| `GET /artists?ids=` (batch) | 403 | Individual artist requests |
| `GET /search` limit | Capped at 10 | Automatic clamping |

See [`references/implementation-notes.md`](references/implementation-notes.md) for full details on each regression and workaround.
